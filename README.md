# Genetic Algorithm for Solving TSP

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.

## 📌 Features
- Uses **selection, crossover, mutation, and evolution** to optimize routes.
- **Fully modular**: separate files for cities & GA logic.
- **Outputs the best tour** with the shortest distance.
- **Saves results to a file (`tsp_results.txt`)**.

## 🚀 How to Run
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lizzydale3/TSP-GeneticAlgorithm.git
cd TSP-GeneticAlgorithm
